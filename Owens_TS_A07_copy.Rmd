## Set up 
1. Set up your session:

* Check your working directory
* Load the tidyverse, lubridate, zoo, and trend packages
* Set your ggplot theme

```{r, message = FALSE}
#1

setwd("C:/Users/Katherine/Documents/872-Data Analytics/Environmental_Data_Analytics_2022")
getwd()

library(lubridate)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
#install.packages("trend")
library(trend)
#install.packages("zoo")
library(zoo)
#install.packages("Kendall")
library(Kendall)
#install.packages("tseries")
library(tseries)

#set ggplot theme
mytheme <- theme_classic(base_size = 12) +
  theme(axis.text = element_text(color = "purple"), 
        legend.position = "bottom")
theme_set(mytheme)
```


2. Import the ten datasets from the Ozone_TimeSeries folder in the Raw data folder. These contain ozone concentrations at Garinger High School in North Carolina from 2010-2019 (the EPA air database only allows downloads for one year at a time). Import these either individually or in bulk and then combine them into a single dataframe named `GaringerOzone` of 3589 observation and 20 variables. 

>Question:how to do this all at one time?


```{r, message = FALSE}
#2

#Read Ozone-NC data
O3_10 <- read.csv("./Data/Raw/Ozone_TimeSeries/EPAair_O3_GaringerNC2010_raw.csv",stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

O3_11 <- read.csv("./Data/Raw/Ozone_TimeSeries/EPAair_O3_GaringerNC2011_raw.csv",stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

O3_12 <- read.csv("./Data/Raw/Ozone_TimeSeries/EPAair_O3_GaringerNC2012_raw.csv",stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

O3_13 <- read.csv("./Data/Raw/Ozone_TimeSeries/EPAair_O3_GaringerNC2013_raw.csv",stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

O3_14 <- read.csv("./Data/Raw/Ozone_TimeSeries/EPAair_O3_GaringerNC2014_raw.csv",stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

O3_15 <- read.csv("./Data/Raw/Ozone_TimeSeries/EPAair_O3_GaringerNC2015_raw.csv",stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

O3_16 <- read.csv("./Data/Raw/Ozone_TimeSeries/EPAair_O3_GaringerNC2016_raw.csv",stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

O3_17 <- read.csv("./Data/Raw/Ozone_TimeSeries/EPAair_O3_GaringerNC2017_raw.csv",stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

O3_18 <- read.csv("./Data/Raw/Ozone_TimeSeries/EPAair_O3_GaringerNC2018_raw.csv",stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

O3_19 <- read.csv("./Data/Raw/Ozone_TimeSeries/EPAair_O3_GaringerNC2019_raw.csv",stringsAsFactors = TRUE)

#Combine into aggregated df
GaringerOzone <- rbind(O3_10, O3_11, O3_12, O3_13, O3_14, O3_15, O3_16, O3_17, O3_18, O3_19)

#to check is a df
is.data.frame(GaringerOzone)
```

## Wrangle

3. Set your date column as a date class.

4. Wrangle your dataset so that it only contains the columns Date, Daily.Max.8.hour.Ozone.Concentration, and DAILY_AQI_VALUE. 

5. Notice there are a few days in each year that are missing ozone concentrations. We want to generate a daily dataset, so we will need to fill in any missing days with NA. Create a new data frame that contains a sequence of dates from 2010-01-01 to 2019-12-31 (hint: `as.data.frame(seq())`). Call this new data frame Days. Rename the column name in Days to "Date".

6. Use a `left_join` to combine the data frames. Specify the correct order of data frames within this function so that the final dimensions are 3652 rows and 3 columns. Call your combined data frame GaringerOzone. 

```{r}
#3

#Format Date
GaringerOzone$Date <- as.Date(GaringerOzone$Date, format = '%m/%d/%Y')

#4

#Make df with only columns Date, Daily.Max.8.hour.Ozone.Concentration, and DAILY_AQI_VALUE. 
GOZ_3 <- select(GaringerOzone, Date, Daily.Max.8.hour.Ozone.Concentration, DAILY_AQI_VALUE)

#5

#create new daily df with all days from '10-'19
?seq.Date
Days <- as.data.frame(seq(as.Date("2010-01-01"), as.Date("2019-12-31"), "day"))

#rename single column in Days to Date
colnames(Days) <- c("Date")

#6

#combine df with missing days with daily df
GaringerOzone <-
  left_join(
  Days,
  GOZ_3)
```

## Visualize

7. Create a line plot depicting ozone concentrations over time. In this case, we will plot actual concentrations in ppm, not AQI values. Format your axes accordingly. Add a smoothed line showing any linear trend of your data. Does your plot suggest a trend in ozone concentration over time?

```{r}
#7

OzoneLine.plot <- ggplot(GaringerOzone, aes(x = Date, y = Daily.Max.8.hour.Ozone.Concentration)) + #Pick variables
  geom_line() + 
  labs(x = "Time", y = expression("Ozone Concentration (ppm)")) +
  geom_smooth(method = lm, color = "purple") #add a trendline
print(OzoneLine.plot)
```

>Answer: Yes there appears to be a seasonality trend, as well as a slightly decreasing ozone concentration trend over time. The concentrations used to be more extreme with the swings between seasons being higher and lower with a range of 0.010-.095ppm. Later in the 2010s the ppm concentration range decreased to .015-0.075 ozone ppm range

## Time Series Analysis

Study question: Have ozone concentrations changed over the 2010s at this station? 

8. Use a linear interpolation to fill in missing daily data for ozone concentration. Why didn't we use a piecewise constant or spline interpolation?

```{r}
#8

summary(GaringerOzone) #63 NAs

GaringerOzone_clean <- #removing NAs
  GaringerOzone %>%  #referencing data frame to use
  mutate(Daily.Max.8.hour.Ozone.Concentration_clean = #making new clean column
           zoo::na.approx(Daily.Max.8.hour.Ozone.Concentration)) #cut NAs

summary(GaringerOzone_clean$Daily.Max.8.hour.Ozone.Concentration_clean)

#line plot of interpolated data
ggplot(GaringerOzone_clean) +
  geom_line(aes(x = Date, y = Daily.Max.8.hour.Ozone.Concentration_clean), color = "blue") +
  geom_line(aes(x = Date, y = Daily.Max.8.hour.Ozone.Concentration), color = "orange") +
  ylab("Linearly Interp. Ozone Concentration (ppm)") 
```

> Answer:  We didn't use piecewise because it would not help with line aspect needed for time series to bridge a gab in data by only providing the nearest neighbor option. We didn't use a spline interpolation because it would add a curved, quadratic line when we only need a straight line in this case to connect the data. Probably better in other uses, but for this exercise the linear interpolation satisfied the linear data need well. 


9. Create a new data frame called `GaringerOzone.monthly` that contains aggregated data: mean ozone concentrations for each month. In your pipe, you will need to first add columns for year and month to form the groupings. In a separate line of code, create a new Date column with each month-year combination being set as the first day of the month (this is for graphing purposes only)

```{r}
#9 (have questions)

GaringerOzone_monthly <- 
  GaringerOzone_clean %>% #creating new df
  mutate(Month = month(Date), #forming new columns(m&yr)
         Year = year(Date)) %>%
  mutate(Date = my(paste0(Month, "-", Year))) %>% #creating new Date column (month-year) combos
  dplyr::group_by(Date, Month, Year) %>%
  dplyr::summarise (Mean_Ozone = mean(Daily.Max.8.hour.Ozone.Concentration_clean)) %>%
  select(Mean_Ozone, Date)
```


10. Generate two time series objects. Name the first `GaringerOzone.daily.ts` and base it on the dataframe of daily observations. Name the second `GaringerOzone.monthly.ts` and base it on the monthly average ozone values. Be sure that each specifies the correct start and end dates and the frequency of the time series.

```{r}
#10

#daily set
f_day <- day(first(GaringerOzone_clean$Date))
f_month <- month(first(GaringerOzone_clean$Date))
f_year <- year(first(GaringerOzone_clean$Date))

GaringerOzone.daily.ts <- ts(GaringerOzone_clean$Date, start = c(f_year, f_month, f_day), frequency=365) 
print(GaringerOzone.daily.ts)

#monthly set 
f_month <- month(first(GaringerOzone_monthly$Date))
f_year <- year(first(GaringerOzone_monthly$Date))
 
GaringerOzone.monthly.ts <- ts(GaringerOzone_monthly$Date, start = c(f_year, f_month), frequency=12) 
print(GaringerOzone.monthly.ts)
```


11. Decompose the daily and the monthly time series objects and plot the components using the `plot()` function.

```{r}
#11

#generate decomposition of data
G_O3_daily_decomp <- stl(GaringerOzone.daily.ts, s.window = "periodic")
plot(G_O3_daily_decomp)
#visualize the decomposed series
G_O3_monthly_decomp <- stl(GaringerOzone.monthly.ts, s.window = "periodic")
plot(G_O3_monthly_decomp)

```


12. Run a monotonic trend analysis for the monthly Ozone series. In this case the seasonal Mann-Kendall is most appropriate; why is this?

```{r}
#12

#run test
G_O3_monthly_SMK1 <- Kendall::SeasonalMannKendall(GaringerOzone.monthly.ts)
#inspect results
G_O3_monthly_SMK1
summary(G_O3_monthly_SMK1)
#run 2nd test
G_O3_monthly_SMK2 <- trend::smk.test(GaringerOzone.monthly.ts)
#inspect results
G_O3_monthly_SMK2
summary(G_O3_monthly_SMK2)
```

> Answer:  The seasonal trend shows up in the monthly data and the only monotonic trend analysis method that can handle seasonality is the Mann-Kendall test. The other method options can be used, but only if the seasonality component is removed ahead of time. 

13. Create a plot depicting mean monthly ozone concentrations over time, with both a geom_point and a geom_line layer. Edit your axis labels accordingly.

```{r}
# 13

G_O3_m_plot <-
ggplot(GaringerOzone_monthly, aes(x = Date, y = Mean_Ozone)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  ylab("O3Concentration Monthly Mean") +
  geom_smooth( method = lm )
print(G_O3_m_plot)
```

14. To accompany your graph, summarize your results in context of the research question (Have ozone concentrations changed over the 2010s at this station?). 

  Include output from the statistical test in parentheses at the end of your sentence. Feel free to use multiple sentences in your interpretation.

> Answer: Decomposing the data confirmed the presence of a seasonal trend in the data. Then the Seasonal Mann Kendall test was used to test stationarity for monotonic trends. For each season of the year represented by tau, we had a value of 1, and a p-vlaue smaller than 0.05 meaning we reject the null hypothesis and have a trend. 

>The SMK.Test was used, we saw statistical levels of pronounced results of tau for each season of the year represented by S in the first column. We also see p-values for each season as well, which represent the presence of a change in the trend. The seasonal S-values showed a consistent, positive trend meaning that was moderately pronounced, and an overall increasing trend over time as shown by the positive S-values. The seasonal p-values were also small overall, less than 0.05, demonstrating a non-stationary change in the seasonal trend over time. 

>To answer the research question, yes the ozone concentrations have increased over the 2010s at this station. 


15. Subtract the seasonal component from the `GaringerOzone.monthly.ts`. Hint: Look at how we extracted the series components for the EnoDischarge on the lesson Rmd file.

16. Run the Mann Kendall test on the non-seasonal Ozone monthly series. Compare the results with the ones obtained with the Seasonal Mann Kendall on the complete series.

```{r}
#15

#Separate the components and turn them into data frame
GaringerOzone.monthly_Components <- as.data.frame(G_O3_monthly_decomp$time.series[,1:3])
#Exclude seasonal column and make new data frame
GaringerO3.monthly_NOseasonal <- GaringerOzone.monthly_Components %>%
  select(trend, remainder) #made df without seasonal column

#make new time series with no seasonality component 
#create second monthly set with old monthly df that has the date info
f_month2 <- month(first(GaringerOzone_monthly$Date))
f_year2 <- year(first(GaringerOzone_monthly$Date))
#make 2nd ts (no seasonality) for tests
GaringerOzone.monthly.ts2 <- ts(GaringerOzone_monthly$Date, start = c(f_year2, f_month2), frequency=12) 
print(GaringerOzone.monthly.ts2)
is.ts(GaringerOzone.monthly.ts2)#check it is a ts and no longer a df
                                # WOOHOO!!! I figured it out! (took a while)

#16

#run test
G_O3_monthly_SMK1.2 <- Kendall::SeasonalMannKendall(GaringerOzone.monthly.ts2)
#inspect results
G_O3_monthly_SMK1.2
summary(G_O3_monthly_SMK1.2)
#run 2nd test
G_O3_monthly_SMK2.2 <- trend::smk.test(GaringerOzone.monthly.ts2)
#inspect results
G_O3_monthly_SMK2.2
summary(G_O3_monthly_SMK2.2)
```

> Answer: After removing the seasonal component, and running the Seasonal Mann Kendall test, tau stayed at a value of 1, and the p-value again was less than 0.05 giving support to reject the null hypothesis. This means we do have the presence of a trend still. 

>When the SMK.Test was used, the seasonal S-values showed a consistent, positive trend STILL meaning that was moderately pronounced, and an overall increasing trend over time as shown by the positive S-values. The seasonal p-values were also STILL small overall, less than 0.05, demonstrating a non-stationary change in the seasonal trend over time. 

>Removing the seasonality component did not seem to change the results in the SeasonalMannKendall and smk.test tests.
